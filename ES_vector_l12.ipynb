      "\n",
      "  1.  Please ensure the accuracy of the order below as Internal shipments from our DCs are processed as \"final sale\". We do not have the ability to process a claim for shortages, damages, or lost shipments. Overages cannot be returned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  1.  Dealer Order WILL NOT be able to provide you with the COST of your order.  This is because the invoicing of orders shipped out of our DCs is processed at Dealer cost.  There is a manual cost centre reconciliation process that happens through Merchandise Accounting and Merch Coordination, ~4-6 wks from invoice date.  This is when S560 will be credited for the invoiced order(s), and the cost centre and account number provided below will be debited at COST.  Please understand that Dealer Order does not know what that cost will be until such time that the adjustment is made.\n",

This run was designed to handle the efficient transportation of time sensitive materials between CTC facilities, including mail and small parcels.  Each parcel is not to weigh more than 50 lbs and must be able to be offloaded by our driver himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next day delivery via our CTC mail van is NOT guaranteed.  Shipments that are eligible to transport via our mail van may or may not be picked up the same day depending on the volume of other time sensitive parcels to be transported on the scheduled mail run (i.e. eCommerce shipments for customer delivery via EAP Vaughan).  If delivery to HO, Retail City, OPC, etc. is required within 24 hrs, please specify in the \"Delivery required(date)\" field highlighted below and Dealer Order will ship via Purolator.\n",

      "Typical factory production between the two factories is 15 million boxes of 100 per week.  As you can see this is rapidly being eaten up by competition. What is currently available for purchase is as follows.    FYI – the quality is a medical grade (surgical) nitrile glove in the industry, and has been provided to different gov’t agencies.   The technical information you are seeing is STANDARD and these are the fastest selling gloves globally.   To be ready for hospital use, we would have to go through a sterilization process, which we can do for a an additional cost, however that’s only typically asked for hospital emergency rooms.   I recommend we create private label package for CTC and labelling them “For Non-Medical Use” just to be safe with Health Canada, and sell to end users.     We’ve done all the research and we know exactly how to market these boxes to make sure that you are legally protected and not at risk of false advertising.
